# Project5 This project was to create a code that reads a clock with both 12 hour and 24 hours. this one is particulary hard for me.
I got it to do one but the second clock wasnt there. I can omprove on all of the coding with c++, im getting better at it but its not so great
like i want it. I do really good with python just not this one. The whole thing was rather difficult for me but i found watching you tube videos
and doing reading helps me alot.I made sure there was no errors and everything was done the correct way and worded the right way.
